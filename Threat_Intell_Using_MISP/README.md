# Threat Intelligence Platform: MISP Lab Project

## Objective

In this lab, I conducted hands-on analysis and research using MISP, a Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP), to deepen my understanding of how threat intelligence functions and impacts organizational security. The lab included tasks focused on ransomware, specific threat actors, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, and vulnerabilities in third-party software. Each task involved investigating particular cyber threats and answering related questions to simulate real-world threat analysis.

## Tasks Overview

### Task 1: Ransomware Research

In Task 1, I explored various ransomware types to understand their characteristics and attack patterns. I focused on identifying the ransomware threat landscape and analyzing intelligence on specific groups like Lockbit and Babuk.


- **Completed Objectives**:
  - Identified the number of MISP events related to ransomware.
  - Analyzed a recent intelligence report on Lockbit, noting key indicators such as domains associated with the ransomware.
  - Located a YARA rule for Babuk, learning about ransom note naming conventions used by this group.

### Task 2: Turla Threat Actor Investigation

Task 2 involved investigating the Turla group, a sophisticated threat actor operating in multiple countries. This exercise aimed to analyze Turla's tactics and assess its methods.

- **Completed Objectives**:
  - Viewed the ATT&CK Matrix for Turla-related events, identifying key Tactics such as Persistence and Privilege Escalation.
  - Counted the total number of MISP events tagged with Turla Group.
  - Examined an older event to discover a decoy document used by Turla in a phishing campaign.

### Task 3: DDoS Attack Analysis

Task 3 centered on Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, particularly on analyzing DDoS Booters and their impact on network availability.

- **Completed Objectives**:
  - Researched DDoS Booters to understand how botnets are rented for launching attacks.
  - Reviewed the CoalaBot malware, noting filename conventions and methods for uploading malicious files.
  - Investigated the Rhombus malware and identified an IP address that infected systems would communicate with.

### Task 4: MiVoice Ransomware Incident

In Task 4, I explored vulnerabilities exploited in MiVoice software and their use in ransomware incidents. I focused on gathering intelligence on vulnerabilities affecting external vendors.


- **Completed Objectives**:
  - Identified the CVE related to MiVoice vulnerabilities and noted the affected software versions.
  - Located an Arctic Wolf report on the attack, including file names and hash values for persistence techniques.
  - Examined the activity timeline of the Lorenz ransomware group, noting their active period.

## Summary of Findings

This lab provided practical experience in using MISP to gather, analyze, and report threat intelligence. I developed insights into ransomware types, threat actor operations, DDoS attack strategies, and the risks posed by vulnerabilities in third-party software. These findings demonstrate the value of MISP for proactive cybersecurity analysis and threat mitigation.
