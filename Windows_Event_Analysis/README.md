# Windows Event Log Analysis Lab

## Objective
This lab focused on analyzing Windows event logs to investigate anomalous account activity, create a timeline of events, and retrieve key information to enhance incident response and digital forensics skills.

## Purpose
The primary goal of this lab was to improve understanding of Windows event logs and their role in detecting and investigating suspicious activity in a Windows domain environment.

## Overview
In this lab, I assumed the role of an **Incident Response Analyst**, tasked with:
- Monitoring and investigating unusual login activities from an administrator account.
- Analyzing Windows event logs to identify unauthorized actions and account manipulations.
- Constructing a timeline of events based on specific log data.

This activity simulated a real-world scenario where monitoring Windows logs is critical for identifying potential security incidents.

## What I Learned
- How to use Event Viewer to parse and analyze Windows event logs.
- The significance of Windows event IDs and their use in tracking user actions.
- Creating a timeline of suspicious activity based on log timestamps.
- Understanding user group membership changes and their implications on system security.

## Key Activities
- Investigated anomalous logins outside an employeeâ€™s standard working hours.
- Identified the creation of a new unauthorized user account.
- Examined user group memberships to understand privilege escalation risks.
- Documented findings in a structured timeline to support the incident investigation.

## Summary
This lab provided valuable experience in analyzing Windows event logs for detecting suspicious behavior, identifying unauthorized account activity, and constructing timelines to support incident investigations. By leveraging tools like Event Viewer, I reinforced my understanding of digital forensics and incident response, which are critical in securing Windows domain-based organizations.
